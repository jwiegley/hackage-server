<h2>Create an Account</h2>

<p>You should first <a href="/users/register-request">register a new user account</a> for yourself and then email <a href="mailto:admins@hackage.haskell.org">admins@hackage.haskell.org</a> to request upload privileges.</p>

<p>If you want to upload a new version for a package uploaded by another user, you should contact that user and request to be added to the package's maintainer group.</p>

<h3>Reset Password</h3>

<p>Passwords are <b>not</b> stored, just the digest.</p>

<p>If you forget your password you can <a href="/users/password-reset">reset it</a>
so long as you know your user login name and the email address you
originally registered with. The system will send you an email with a
link you can use to set a new password.</p>
